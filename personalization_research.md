1. Bottom-Up and Top-Down: Predicting Personality with Psycholinguistic and Language Model Features

- use online data on human behavior and preferences (i.e., digital footprints) to automatically predict individuals’ levels of personality traits
- big 5 : Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, Extraversion, and Neuroticism or positively keyed, emotional stability
- language model-based approaches far outperform the traditional closed vocab ones for personality prediction
- larger language model does not always result in higher performance.
- the results of our interpretable machine learning analysis partially align with past, associative findings from personality psychology and underline the expressiveness of language use for individual differences

2. Predicting Personality from Social Media Text - Jennifer Golbeck

- use LIWC and its tool Receptiviti
  - Receptitiviti API : estimates of Bif Five personality traits based on a text sample
- 4 social media posts datasets from facebook, twitter
- predict big 5 personality with Receptiviti, samples' ground truth big 5 personality was previously measured
- error had a fairly wide range across the five personality traits

3. Predicting Personality with Social Media

- In this paper, we have shown that a users’ Big Five person- ality traits can be predicted from the public information they share on Facebook.

- analysing correlation between personality inventory(ground truth) and big 5 personality features using facebook data
- predicting personality with dot-producting the feature vector, train two ML also (m5sup/rules and Gaussian Processes)
- considered two structural features - number of friends and network density
- 연구 활용 방안 : With the ability to in- fer a user’s personality, social media websites, e-commerce retailers, and even ad servers can be tailored to reflect the user’s personality traits and present information such that users will be most receptive to it. 

4. On friendship development and the big five personality traits

- Our review suggests that **agreeableness** has the most consistent effects on both roman- tic relationships and friendships, followed by **neuroticism**. Extraver- sion, conscientiousness, and openness to experience have all been shown to influence relationship development, but their effects are inconsistent. 
- actor : who is more likely to initiate and end friendships, partner : who is more likely to be the target of friendship initiation and termination
- 참고문헌중 읽어볼만한 것 : the role of personality traits for friendship development (e.g., Wilson, Harris, & Vazire, 2015)
- paper focuses on two stages of friendship devel- opment: formation and maintenance.
- Extraversion: willing to make more friends
  - Actor effects
    - Extraverts' positive experiences with others, coupled with the sociability that characterizes extraversion, could drive them to approach others more and to be more willing to engage with strangers than introverts.
  - Partner effects
    - In short, extraverts seem to be liked more at first, but they are not necessarily more prone to elicit liking after the first impression.
  - dyadic effects
    - Similarity in extraversion can impact friendship formation. People, particularly introverts, tend to like others who match their level of extraversion 
  - summary
    - it is easy to imagine how friendships could look very different depending on the combination of extraversion levels (i.e., high‐high vs. high‐low vs. low‐low).
    - Nelson, Thorne, and Shapiro (2011) began studying the dynamics of matched versus mismatched friendships, but there is still more work to be done on this topic.
- Agreeableness
- matching시 trait들중 우선순위를 정하는건 어떨까? agreeableness 1위
- 매칭시 friendship maintanance 보단 formation에 중점을 두는게 어떨까?
